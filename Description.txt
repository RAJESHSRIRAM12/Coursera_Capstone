The Battle of Neighborhoods - Coursera Capstone Project


1) Introduction :


As the current Pandemic of the Covid-19 which is affecting the whole world, many people are admiited to the hospital for fighting against 
the Covid-19  which is a cruicial thing for the surivial of the people. So at the present situation the restaurant or the mall doesnt matters.
What matters is the hospital.

This Project attempts to compare the hospitals in these both cities and compare it with the population to determine whether these
hospitals are sufficients for the patient in these neighbohrhood 


The assumption and factor considered for this project is that each hospitals admit the same number of patients

So what the problems aims is to 

a) compare the population of the bourough in the city of newyork and toronto

b) using four square compare the no of hospitals in the city of newyork and toronto

c) compare the number of covid cases in the city of newyork and toronto 


This aims to see whether the population and hospital have any effect on the number of Covid-19 cases in these cities




2) Data:

a)Population of the Bourough in New York City : https://www.citypopulation.de/en/usa/newyorkcity/

b) Population of the Borough in Toronto City  : for this only the east, central, downtown and west toronto is considered. An attempt will be made to see whether the population of 
these cities can be scrapped from the web, when in case it is not presented a table will be created which mentions these population.

c)Geo-spacial data of the New York and Toronto city  to get a better understanding of the neighborhoods in it and their corresponding locations in the Folium map would make 
certain things clear for the Project. This will be achieved using the acquired data and visualize the same using Choropleth maps

d) Finally the data going to be collected/acquired from the Foursquare API about the various hopsitals in each neighborhood of New York city  
which will be used for acquiring the information regarding same for all the venues of each neighborhoodof the toronto cities
